# Non-Functional Requirements for Sock Shop

# TODO:

- [ ] Performance requirements (response times, throughput)
- [ ]	Scalability requirements (user load, data volume)
- [ ]	Security requirements (authentication, authorization, data protection)
- [ ]	Reliability requirements (uptime, fault tolerance)
- [ ]	Maintainability requirements (monitoring, logging, debugging)


---
# EXAMPLE:

## Performance
- NFR-P1: All page loads must complete within 2 seconds under normal load
- NFR-P2: The system must support at least 100 concurrent users
- NFR-P3: API endpoints must respond within 500ms

## Scalability
- NFR-S1: The system must be able to scale horizontally to handle increased load
- NFR-S2: The system must support auto-scaling based on CPU and memory metrics
- NFR-S3: Database services must be able to scale with increasing data volume

## Security
- NFR-SEC1: All user passwords must be stored using strong hashing algorithms
- NFR-SEC2: All communication between services must be encrypted
- NFR-SEC3: The system must implement proper authentication and authorization
- NFR-SEC4: Sensitive data must be protected at rest and in transit

## Reliability
- NFR-R1: The system must have 99.9% uptime
- NFR-R2: The system must be resilient to the failure of individual services
- NFR-R3: Data must be backed up regularly with a recovery plan

## Maintainability
- NFR-M1: All services must implement health check endpoints
- NFR-M2: All services must log appropriate information for debugging
- NFR-M3: The system must provide metrics for monitoring performance
